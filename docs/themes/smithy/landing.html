                <p>Smithy is designed to work with any programming language, describe
                    services running in any environment, and work with any kind of transport or

                <p>Smithy models can be extended through <em>traits</em>. There are
                    many built-in traits to affect things like behavior and serialization,
                    and custom traits can be added for additional functionality.</p>

                <p>Smithy is defined in terms of resources and operations you can enact on
                    them. Explicitly defining resources provides rich metadata about an API
                    that can be used to build higher-level client tooling and derive
                    artifacts from a model.</p>

            <h2>Why did you develop Smithy?</h2>
            <p>With thousands of operations across hundreds of public web services, AWS
                needed a simple way to describe APIs that could adapt to change and support a
                wide range of services. At AWS, we provide our customers with extensive
                documentation, strongly typed client libraries, high-level abstractions like
                paginators, and tooling in many different programming languages. Existing
                interface definition languages available outside of AWS were either not
                compatible with our existing services, not extensible enough to meet our
                needs, or not strict enough to provide the right customer experience.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smithy isn't really new.</strong> The Smithy IDL is an
                evolution of an interface definition language that was developed
                internally at Amazon. Smithy models are compatible with the
                tens-of-thousands of web services used internally within Amazon
                and the hundreds of web services provided by AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smithy is built for code generation and tools.</strong>
                Smithy models were designed for the purpose of generating clients,
                servers, and documentation in multiple programming languages. To achieve
                this, Smithy models are completely normalized, which makes models easy
                to traverse, validate, and diff. Normalization also ensures that every
                shape has an explicit name to aid in code generation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smithy balances extensibility and constraints.</strong> Traits
                are used to extend a model and add capabilities that are not part of the
                core specification. For example, AWS defines AWS-specific traits that are
                used to generate other metadata documents that are derived from Smithy
                models. While extensibility is a key design requirement, Smithy provides
                a built-in validation system for ensuring that traits are used properly,
                don't conflict with other traits, are applied only to the correct places
                in a model, and are configured correctly when used in a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smithy is protocol agnostic.</strong>
                Smithy decouples the transport layer of web services from the data
                structures and capabilities of the service so that they can evolve
                independently.
            </p>

            <h2>Why is Smithy protocol-agnostic?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most web service customers don't care about the wire-level format of the
                    web services they consume; they care about how they can easily and
                    efficiently integrate their systems with a web service in a way thatâ€™s
                    idiomatic to the language of their choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Requirements of web services and clients change over time. XML was once
                    the dominant serialization format of the Web, but that distinction has
                    now been passed on to JSON. As web service providers grow and face
                    scaling challenges, they might wish to utilize a more efficient binary
                    protocol rather than using JSON or even HTTP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A protocol-agnostic IDL focuses more on the interfaces and abstractions
                    that are provided to customers rather than bytes over the wire.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between Smithy and OpenAPI?</h2>
            <p>The primary difference between Smithy and OpenAPI is that Smithy is
                protocol-agnostic. This allows Smithy to describe a broader range of services,
                metadata, and capabilities.</p>
