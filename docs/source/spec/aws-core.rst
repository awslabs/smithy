General AWS Traits
------------------

These AWS traits are used to supply general information for integration with
other AWS Services and the AWS SDKs.

.. _aws.api#service-trait:

``aws.api#service`` trait
=========================

Summary
    An AWS service is defined using the ``aws.api#service`` trait. This
    trait provides information about the service like the name used to
    generate AWS SDK client classes and the namespace used in ARNs.
Trait selector
    ``service``
Value type
    ``object`` that contains the following properties:

    * :ref:`service-sdk-id` (required)
    * :ref:`service-cloudformation-name`
    * :ref:`service-arn-namespace`
    * :ref:`service-cloudtrail-event-source`
    * :ref:`service-abbreviation`

The following example defines an AWS service that uses the default values of
``cloudFormationService``, ``arnNamespace``, and ``cloudTrailEventSource``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        $version: "0.2.0"
        namespace aws.fooBaz

        use trait aws.api#service

        @service(sdkId: "Some Value")
        service FooBaz {
          version: "2018-03-17",
        }

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "aws.fooBaz": {
                "shapes": {
                    "FooBaz": {
                        "type": "service",
                        "version": "2018-03-17",
                        "aws.api#service": {
                            "sdkId": "Some Value"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

The following example provides explicit values for all properties:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        $version: "0.2.0"
        namespace aws.fooBaz

        use trait aws.api#service

        @service(
            sdkId: "Some Value",
            cloudFormationName: "FooBaz",
            arnNamespace: "myservice",
            cloudTrailEventSource: "myservice.amazon.aws")
        service FooBaz {
          version: "2018-03-17",
        }

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "aws.fooBaz": {
                "shapes": {
                    "FooBaz": {
                        "type": "service",
                        "version": "2018-03-17",
                        "aws.api#service": {
                            "sdkId": "Some Value",
                            "cloudFormationName": "FooBaz",
                            "arnNamespace": "myservice",
                            "cloudTrailEventSource": "myservice.amazon.aws"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }


.. _service-sdk-id:

``sdkId``
---------

The ``sdkId`` property is a **required** ``string`` value that specifies
the AWS SDK service ID (e.g., "API Gateway"). This value is used for
generating client names in SDKs and for linking between services.

* The value MUST be unique across all AWS services.
* The value must match the following regex: ``^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*( [a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$``.
  To summarize, the value can only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. However,
  the first character cannot be a number, and when using spaces, each space must be
  between two alphanumeric characters.
* The value MUST NOT contain "AWS", "Aws", or "Amazon".
* The value must not case-insensitively end with "API", "Client", or "Service".
* The value MUST NOT change change once a service is publicly released. If the value
  does change, the service will be considered a brand new service in the AWS SDKs
  and Tools.


Choosing an SDK service ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``sdkId`` value should reasonably represent the service it identifies. ``sdkId``
MUST NOT be an arbitrary value; for example for Amazon DynamoDB, an appropriate
"serviceId" would be "DynamoDB" while an inappropriate value would be "Foo".

The following steps can be taken to produce a ``sdkId`` that should generally work
for most services:

1. Pick a base to derive the "sdkId". If available, use the ``abbreviation``
   property of the ``aws.api#service`` trait as the base. An example of an official
   service abbreviation is ``Amazon S3`` for ``Amazon Simple Storage Service``.
   If the service has no official service abbreviation, then use the service's
   official name as specified by the :ref:`title-trait` (for example,
   ``Amazon Simple Storage Service``).
2. Remove "Service", "Client", and "API" from the end of the base string.
   The only acceptable reason for including these in the base is if one of
   those words are actually part of the official name of a service.
3. Remove any use of AWS or Amazon from the base.
4. Strip off any leading or trailing whitespace.
5. Remove any characters that are not alphanumeric or spaces.
6. Remove any leading digits until the value begins with a letter.

See :ref:`aws-service-appendix-a` for a table containing various AWS services
and their SDK service IDs.


Using SDK service ID for client naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless explicitly overridden though other traits or configuraiton, AWS SDKs
SHOULD use the ``sdkId`` property when choosing the name of a client class.

For the AWS CLI, the typical value need to use a command involves both
lower-casing all characters of the ``sdkId`` and removing all spaces. So
for the "serviceId" of "API Gateway", the CLI command would be:

::

    $ aws apigateway

In the AWS SDK for PHP, a client class name SHOULD be derived by lower-casing
all letters that are not the first letter of a word, removing all spaces, and
appending the word "Client" to the final transformed "serviceId". So for the
"serviceId" of "API Gateway", the PHP client would be: ``ApiGatewayClient``.

Other AWS SDKs SHOULD follow a similar pattern when choosing client names.


.. _service-cloudformation-name:

``cloudFormationName``
----------------------

The ``cloudFormationName`` property is a ``string`` value that specifies
the `AWS CloudFormation service name`_ (e.g., ``ApiGateway``). When not set,
this value defaults to the name of the service shape. This value is part of
the CloudFormation resource type name that is automatically assigned to
resources in the service (e.g., ``AWS::<NAME>::resourceName``). This value
must match the following regex: ``^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]+$``.


.. _service-arn-namespace:

``arnNamespace``
----------------

The ``arnNamespace`` property is a ``string`` value that defines the
`ARN service namespace`_ of the service (e.g., "apigateway"). This value is
used in ARNs assigned to resources in the service. If not set, this value
defaults to the lowercase name of the service shape. This value must match
the following regex: ``^[a-z0-9.\-]{1,63}$``.

If not set, this value defaults to the name of the service shape converted
to lowercase. This value is combined with resources contained within the
service to form ARNs for resources. Only resources that explicitly define
the :ref:`aws.api#arn-trait` are assigned ARNs, and their relative ARNs
are combined with the service's arnNamespace to form an ARN.


.. _service-cloudtrail-event-source:

``cloudTrailEventSource``
-------------------------

The ``cloudTrailEventSource`` property is a ``string`` value that defines the
*eventSource* property contained in CloudTrail `event records`_
emitted by the service. If not specified, this value defaults to the
``arnNamespace`` plus .amazonaws.com. For example:

* AWS CloudFormation has an ``arnNamespace`` of ``cloudformation`` and an
  event source of ``cloudformation.amazonaws.com``.
* Amazon EC2 has an ``arnNamespace`` of ``ec2`` and an event source of
  ``ec2.amazonaws.com``.
* Amazon Simple Workflow Service has an ``arnNamespace`` of ``swf`` and
  an event source of ``swf.amazonaws.com``.

This convention has some exceptions. For example, the event source for
Amazon CloudWatch is ``monitoring.amazonaws.com``. Such services will
need to explicitly configure the ``cloudTrailEventSource`` setting.


.. _service-abbreviation:

``abbreviation``
----------------

The ``abbreviation`` property is a ``string`` value that defines the official
abbreviation of a service. For example, the official abbreviation of
"Amazon Simple Storage Service" is "Amazon S3", and the abbreviation of
"Amazon Kinesis Firehose" is "Firehose".

See :ref:`aws-service-appendix-a` for a table containing various AWS services
and their abbreviations.


.. _aws.api#arn-trait:

``aws.api#arn`` trait
=====================

Trait summary
    Defines an ARN of a Smithy resource shape.
Trait selector
    ``resource``
Trait value
    ``object``

The ``aws.api#arn`` trait is an object that supports the following
properties:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - template
      - ``string``
      - **Required** Defines the ARN template. The provided string contains
        URI-template style label placeholders that contain the name of one of
        the identifiers defined in the ``identifiers`` property of the
        resource. These labels can be substituted at runtime with the actual
        identifiers of the resource. Every identifier name of the resource
        MUST have corresponding label of the same name. Note that
        percent-encoding **is not** performed on these placeholder values;
        they are to be replaced literally. For relative ARN templates that
        have not set ``absolute`` to ``true``, the template string contains
        only the resource part of the ARN (for example, ``foo/{MyResourceId}``).
        Relative ARNs MUST NOT start with "/".
    * - noRegion
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to specify that the ARN does not contain a region.
        If not set, or if set to false, the resolved ARN will contain a
        placeholder for the region. This can only be set to true if
        ``absolute`` is not set or is false.
    * - noAccount
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to specify that the ARN does not contain an account ID.
        If not set, or if set to false, the resolved ARN will contain a
        placeholder for the customer account ID. This can only be set to
        true if absolute is not set or is false.
    * - absolute
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to indicate that the ARN template contains a fully-formed
        ARN that does not need to be merged with the service. This type of
        ARN MUST be used when the identifier of a resource is an ARN or is
        based on the ARN identifier of a parent resource.


Format of an ARN
----------------

An ARN is is a structured URI made up of the following components:

.. code-block:: none

    arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
                             \       /
                         Both are optional

partition
    The partition that the resource is in. For standard AWS regions, the
    partition is "aws". If you have resources in other partitions, the
    partition is aws-partitionname. For example, the partition for resources
    in the China (Beijing) region is aws-cn.
service
    The service namespace that identifies the AWS product (for example,
    Amazon S3 is "s3", IAM is "iam", and Amazon RDS is "rds"). For a list
    of namespaces, see `AWS Service Namespaces`_. The namespace used by
    Smithy services is defined by the ``arnNamespace`` property of the
    :ref:`aws.api#service-trait`.
region
    The region the resource resides in. Note that the ARNs for some resources
    do not require a region, so this component MAY be omitted.
account-id
    The ID of the AWS account that owns the resource, without the hyphens. For
    example, ``123456789012``. Note that the ARNs for some resources don't
    require an account number, so this component MAY be omitted.
resource
    Defines a specific resource within a service. The content of this segment of
    an ARN varies by service. It often includes an indicator of the type of
    resource—for example, an IAM user or Amazon RDS database —followed by a
    slash (/) or a colon (:), followed by the resource name itself. Some
    services allow paths for resource names, as described in Paths in ARNs.

Some example ARNs from various services include:

.. code-block:: none

    // Elastic Beanstalk application version
    arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-east-1:123456789012:environment/My App/MyEnvironment

    // IAM user name
    arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David

    // Amazon RDS instance used for tagging
    arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:123456789012:db:mysql-db

    // Object in an Amazon S3 bucket
    arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/exampleobject.png


Relative ARN templates
----------------------

``arn`` traits with relative templates are combined with the service to form an
absolute ARN template. This ARN template can only be expanded at runtime with
actual values for the partition, region name, account ID, and identifier
label placeholders.

For example, given the following service:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        $version: "0.2.0"
        namespace aws.fooBaz

        use trait aws.api#service
        use trait aws.api#arn

        @service(sdkId: "Some Value")
        service FooBaz {
          version: "2018-03-17",
          resources: [MyResource],
        }

        @arn(template: "myresource/{myId}")
        resource MyResource {
          identifiers: {myId: MyResourceId},
        }

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
          "smithy": "0.2.0",
          "smithy.example": {
            "shapes": {
              "FooBaz": {
                "type": "service",
                "version": "2018-03-17",
                "resources": ["MyResource"],
                "aws.api#service": {
                  "sdkId": "Some Value"
                }
              },
              "MyResource": {
                "type": "resource",
                "identifiers": {"myId": "MyResourceId"},
                "aws.api#arn": {
                  "template": "myresource/{myId}"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }

The ARN template assigned to ``MyResource`` when used with the ``FooBaz``
service expands to ``arn:{AWS::partition}:myservice:{AWS::Region}:{AWS::AccountId}:myresource/{myId}``
at runtime. The label ``{myId}`` indicates that the value of the resource's
identifier is to be inserted into the ARN template when resolving it at
runtime.


Using an ARN as a resource identifier
-------------------------------------

*Absolute* ARN templates are used to provide an entire ARN to a resource that
is not combined with the service ARN namespace. When a resource uses an ARN as
its identifier, an absolute ARN template MUST be defined on the resource
that uses a placeholder containing the name of the identifier of the
resource.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        use trait aws.api#arn
        use trait aws.api#arnReference

        @arn(template: "{arn}", absolute: true)
        resource MyResource {
          identifiers: {arn: Arn}
        }

        @arnReference(service: FooBaz, resource: MyResource)
        string Arn

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
          "smithy": "0.2.0",
          "smithy.example": {
            "shapes": {
              "MyResource": {
                "type": "resource",
                "identifiers": {
                  "arn": "Arn"
                },
                "aws.api#arn": {
                  "template": "{arn}",
                  "absolute": true
                }
              },
              "Arn": {
                "type": "string",
                "aws.api#arnReference": {
                  "service": "FooBaz",
                  "resource": "MyResource"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }


.. _aws.api#arnReference-trait:

``aws.api#arnReference`` trait
==============================

Trait summary
    Specifies that a string shape contains a fully formed AWS ARN.
Trait selector
    ``string``
Trait value
    ``object``

Smithy models can refer to AWS resources using ARNs. The
``aws.api#arnReference`` can be applied to a string shape to indicate
that the string contains an ARN and what resource is targeted by the
ARN.

The ``aws.api#arnReference`` trait is an object that supports the following
optional properties:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - type
      - ``string``
      -  The AWS `CloudFormation resource type`_ contained in the ARN.
         Example: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    * - service
      - ``string``
      - The Smithy service shape ID that is referenced by the ARN. This
        shape ID MAY be relative to the current namespace. The targeted
        service is not required to be found in the model, allowing for
        external shapes to be referenced without needing to take on an
        additional dependency.
    * - resource
      - ``string``
      - A shape ID that references the Smithy resource type contained in the
        ARN (e.g., ``com.foo#SomeResource``). This shape ID MAY be relative to
        the current namespace. The targeted resource is not required to be
        found in the model, allowing for external shapes to be referenced
        without needing to take on an additional dependency. If the shape is
        found in the model, it MUST target a resource shape, and the resource
        MUST be found within the closure of the referenced service shape.

The following example defines a string shape that targets an AWS resource.
The CloudFormation name of the resource and the Smithy service and resource
shape IDs are provided to give tooling additional information about the
referenced resource.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        $version: "0.2.0"
        namespace smithy.example

        use trait aws.api#arnReference

        @arnReference(
            type: "AWS::SomeService::SomeResource",
            service: com.foo#SomeService,
            resource: com.foo#SomeResource)
        string SomeResourceId

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "smithy.example": {
                "shapes": {
                    "SomeResourceId": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "aws.api#arnReference": {
                            "type": "AWS::SomeService::SomeResource",
                            "service": "com.foo#SomeService",
                            "resource": "com.foo#SomeResource"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

The following example defines an ARN reference that doesn't provide an context
about the referenced shape. While this is valid, it is not as useful as the
previous example:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        $version: "0.2.0"
        namespace smithy.example

        use trait aws.api#arnReference

        @arnReference
        string SomeResourceId

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "smithy.example": {
                "shapes": {
                    "SomeResourceId": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "aws.api#arnReference": {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }


.. _aws.api#unsignedPayload-trait:

``aws.api#unsignedPayload`` trait
=================================

Summary
    Indicates that the payload of an operation is not to be part of the
    signature computed for the request of an operation.

    Providing a list of strings will limit the effect of this trait to
    only specific authentication schemes by name. An empty list of strings
    causes this trait to apply to all authentication schemes used with the
    the operation.
Trait selector
    ``operation``
Value type
    List of authentication scheme strings

Most requests sent to AWS services require that the payload of the request is
signed. However, in some cases, a service that streams large amounts of data
with an unknown size at the time a request is initiated might require that the
payload of a request is not signed.

The following example defines an operation that indicates the payload of the
operation MUST NOT be used as part of the request signature calculation:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        use trait aws.api#unsignedPayload

        @unsignedPayload
        operation PutThings(PutThingsInput) -> PutThingsOutput

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "smithy.example": {
                "shapes": {
                    "PutThings": {
                        "type": "operation",
                        "input": "PutThingsInput",
                        "output": "PutThingsOutput",
                        "aws.api#unsignedPayload": []
                    }
                }
            }
        }

The following example defines an operation that requires an unsigned payload
only when using the "aws.v4" authentication scheme:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: smithy

        use trait aws.api#unsignedPayload

        @unsignedPayload(["aws.v4"])
        operation PutThings(PutThingsInput) -> PutThingsOutput

    .. code-tab:: json

        {
            "smithy": "0.2.0",
            "smithy.example": {
                "shapes": {
                    "PutThings": {
                        "type": "operation",
                        "input": "PutThingsInput",
                        "output": "PutThingsOutput",
                        "aws.api#unsignedPayload": ["aws.v4"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }


Unsigned Payloads and signature version 4
-----------------------------------------

Using an unsigned payload with `AWS signature version 4`_ requires that the
literal string ``UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`` is used when constructing a
`canonical request`_, and the same value is sent in the
`x-amz-content-sha256`_ header when sending an HTTP request.

.. _aws.v4-auth:

``aws.v4`` Authentication
=========================

The ``aws.v4`` authentication scheme is used to indicate that a service
supports `AWS signature version 4`_. This authentication scheme does not
require any configuration settings. The service name used in the
signature version 4 credential scope defaults to the resolved value of the
``aws.api#service`` trait :ref:`service-arn-namespace` property (that is,
if the value is explicitly defined, then use it, otherwise use the name of
the service converted to lowercase characters).

.. _aws-iam_traits:

-----------------
IAM Policy Traits
-----------------

IAM Policy Traits are used to describe the permission structure of a service
in relation to AWS IAM. Services integrated with AWS IAM define resource types,
actions, and condition keys that IAM users can use to construct IAM policies.

`Actions`_ and `resource types`_ are automatically inferred from a service
model via operations and resources, respectively. Actions can also be annotated
with other `actions that they depend on`_ to be invoked.

`Condition keys`_ are available for IAM users to define restrictions in IAM
policies for resources in a service. Condition keys for services defined in
Smithy are automatically inferred. These can be disabled or augmented. For
more information, see :ref:`deriving-condition-keys`.

.. _deriving-condition-keys:

Deriving Condition Keys
=======================

Smithy will automatically derive condition key information for a service, as
well as its resources and operations.

A resource's condition keys include those that are inferred from their
identifiers, including the resource's ancestors, and those applied via the
:ref:`aws.iam#conditionKeys-trait` trait. Condition keys for resource
identifiers are automatically inferred unless explicitly configured not to via
the :ref:`aws.iam#disableConditionKeyInference-trait` trait.

An action's condition keys, including for actions for operations bound to
resources, are only derived from those applied via the :ref:`aws.iam#conditionKeys-trait`
trait.

Given the following model,
