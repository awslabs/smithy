/**
 * Provides an index of {@link Shape}s in a Smithy model by {@link ShapeId}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ShapeIndex} represents a Smithy model in a flat graph-like
 * index. Shapes reference other shapes by shape ID, and these shape IDs are
 * used then matched with shapes in a {@code ShapeIndex}.
 *
 * Using this kind of graph-like structure rather than a something more like
 * a tree allows for a fast iteration over all shapes in a model, allows for
 * shapes to reference other shapes without requiring cyclic references, and
 * maps cleanly to the mental model of a Smithy model definition (that is,
 * shape IDs are used to connect shapes to other shapes, allow traits to be
 * applied to shapes, and are used to suppress validation events). However,
 * this does come with the trade-off that the {@code ShapeIndex} may be an an
 * invalid state when it is accessed. As such, a {@code ShapeIndex} should be
 * thoroughly validated before it is utilized.
