[ERROR] (ResourceIdentifierBinding) ns.foo#InvalidResourceOperation1 / [44, 36]: This operation does not form a valid instance operation when bound to resource `ns.foo#InvalidResource`. All of the identifiers of the resource were not implicitly or explicitly bound to the input of the operation. Expected the following identifier bindings: [required member named `foo` that targets `smithy.api#String`]. Found the following identifier bindings: []
[ERROR] (ResourceIdentifierBinding) ns.foo#InvalidResourceOperation2 / [55, 23]: This operation is marked with the `collection` trait but is bound to the `ns.foo#InvalidResource` resource using an instance binding, meaning that all of the identifiers of the resource are bound to members of the operation input.
